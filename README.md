  abstract = "Recently, NLP tasks need many datasets because of the use of
              transformer architecture. However, the amount of datasets is
              limited since it is created by humans. So we strive to improve it
              by using the Pseudo-Labeling approach in Semi-Supervised
              learning. This paper creates the model of sentimental
              classification by Fine-Tuning using the Pseudo-Label which is
              generated by Self-Training, and evaluates it.",
